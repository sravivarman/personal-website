intro: >-
  Hi! I'm Felipe Cordero, a **structural engineer** 🏗️ and **full stack developer** 💻 with **14+ years** in AEC and software development, now specializing in **AI/ML** 🤖. My journey has taken me from **Chile to Montréal**, where I combine traditional engineering with modern technology to solve complex problems in engineering and automation. Currently, I'm an **AI and Full Stack Developer** at <a href="https://fireraven.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fireraven</strong></a>, building security and compliance solutions for LLM-based AI agents. Recently, I was honored with the **Academic Excellence Scholarship** (Air Canada, Collège LaSalle Montréal, 2025) 🏆 for my achievements in AI/ML studies.

study: >-
  Currently based in **Montréal** 🇨🇦, I'm deepening my skills in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** 🤖 at **Collège LaSalle**. I work with **Python** 🐍, **PyTorch**, and **predictive modeling** 📊 to build intelligent systems that bridge the gap between engineering and data science.

passion_text: >-
  I'm passionate about learning and applying **AI to real-world engineering challenges** 🔬. At <a href="https://fireraven.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fireraven</strong></a>, I design and develop **scalable full-stack solutions** using **Python (FastAPI, NestJS)** and **React (Next.js, TypeScript)** for LLM-based security and compliance platforms, maintaining a **50/50 split between backend and frontend development** ⚖️. I implement and optimize **PostgreSQL databases**, apply **OOP principles and design patterns (DRY, YAGNI, SOLID)** to build maintainable codebases, and collaborate with **global distributed teams** in Agile Scrum environments 🤝. Previously at <a href="https://obralink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ObraLink</strong></a>, I led the development of **autonomous structural analysis tools** and **ML models** for concrete estimation 🏢. My goal is to create **innovative solutions** that have a real impact on the built environment.

mix: >-
  With experience in both **structural engineering** 🏗️ and **software development** 💻, I bring a **unique perspective** to technical challenges. I've led teams in building everything from **physical structures to scalable software systems**, always focusing on **practical, efficient solutions** ⚡. My **international background** and commitment to **continuous learning** drive me to bridge disciplines and deliver value across industries.

personal: >-
  Outside work, I enjoy **tennis** 🎾, **cooking** 👨‍🍳, **drums** 🥁, **swimming** 🏊‍♂️, and **photography** 📸. I also **volunteer at LaSalle College**, helping new students settle in and supporting the academic community 🤝.
